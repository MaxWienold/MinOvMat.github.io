## Who Am I?

Hi, my name is Max Wienold and I am quer.Gestaltet.
I am a 30 year old web developer based in Germany. I am stoked to make the web more beautiful!








Personal!

As a developer, who mainly focuses on the front-end, I see myself as a bridge between technology and design. While I appreciate a visually compelling Layout and interactive experiences, I am also enthusiastic about underlying structures and solving problems of rendering dynamic content. I am looking for opportunities to make appearances on the web a pleasant experience.

When I made my first experiences with the Internet, it was making strange noises and I had to wait eternities to see those awesome "home pages". Little did I know…

Since then, so much has developed and the possibilities to express yourself on the web have become increasingly complex and mature.

But Although I always were fascinated by the ways our lives are influenced by this medium, it still needed some years for me to fall in love with making the web come alive myself.

While I was an intern at freiraum verlag, a publishing house, I got the chance to revise one of their author’s web presence. It was not long until I became so captivated and ever more passionate about creating for the web that I decided to take it to another level and to enroll in b.i.b. college for Media Information.

In the two years I spent there, I was able to deepen my understanding of good Web- and App-development. I became fluent in the web’s languages HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript and learned such dialects as  SASS, JQuery and gained insights into the professional process of working on extensive projects is like and how to better communicate myself. Also I built a core competence of programming with Java.

Two years later, I graduated. But I never stop learning and I am constantly looking out for my personal growth and development. There always are challenges to be met and new technologies to be discovered!

## Services

Every project has its own demands. Together, we surely can determine which cause of action is the right one for your dream to become real.

### Concepting

If you found your way to this page, chances are pretty good, you have something to say. And chances are also good, you are not really sure how to do it best. After you have told me about your project, we will discover your message and dive into which problems you really need me to fix. Why do you really need a website? Sometimes, some building blocks for your success are missing and sometimes, a bit less-is-more attitude is needed.
With the results of our talks and my research and in close communication with you, I will sketch out the way to address your audience and define the your Websites outlines and its requirements.

### Front-End

The web is constantly moving forward. To be up-to-date when it comes to the opportunities, new technologies are offering, is essential for making a good impression. I strive to be able to offer you everything that is possible and not more than what you need.

To build an immersive and diverting experience for your users and that serves your goal the best is not only my job, but my personal passion.

### Back-End

Depending on your plans, it might be necessary to build your site with a Content Management System that allows you to easily add, edit and delete certain areas of your page. But for more complex applications I am able to build your custom administration panel tailored especially for your needs.

When it comes to get your site up and running on a server, I will find the ideal provider and I will take care of the necessary steps.
