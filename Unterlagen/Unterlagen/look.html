    <p>If you need an impression of what i can do for you,
here are some of the projects i have worked on recently.
And as always: Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="iwi-design">iwi design</h2>
<h4 id="briefing">Briefing</h4>
<p>The graphic designer and illustrator Isabel Wienold asked me to relaunch her site in a more interactive way and also modernise the overall aesthetics.</p>
<h4 id="process">Process</h4>
<p>The existing site foremost lacked intuitive structure and also in the personal presentation in word and image. I encouraged the client to limit and structure herself. This phase of research proved the most extensive and important one. For the aesthetical guidelines, I worked with the client, researched trends and suggested technical possibilities. The  development of the graphics, however was her ressort.</p>
<h4 id="tech">Tech</h4>
<p>For the amount of content that would be on the site, a CMS that relies on a database seemed too extensive. For this reason, I decided to use Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator that is able to build templates and DOM-trees based on data defined in YAML-frontmatter.</p>
<h2 id="minpho">minpho</h2>
<h3 id="briefing">Briefing</h3>
<p>The Photographer Klaus Schick, based in Bielefeld needed a site to showcase his <strong>mi</strong>ndfull <strong>pho</strong>tography. It should have a simplistic, calm look and focus on the content, that are: the images.</p>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>A logo and corporate design was already existent. I  incorporated the colors, logo and elements in the site and</p>
<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
<p>To make it possible for the client to mantain the
content himself, it was clear for me that i would
use a CMS of some sorts. I gave wordpress the preference,
because of its broad community and extensive documentation.
Also, the interface is fairly straight-forward and easy to get used to.</p>
<h2 id="datalus">datalus</h2>
<h4 id="use-case">Use Case</h4>
<p>Most Content Management Systems make assumptions on how your content is to be used and displayed. some are quite rigid in this regard, others allow some flexibility. But if you need more than that, you probably just want your content. nothing more, nothing less. That&#39;s what datalus is about. It should be a breeze to create your custom and project-specific taxonomy and access it in te format you need. May it be XML, JSON or even GraphQL.</p>
<h2 id="lifetime">lifetime</h2>
<h4 id="use-case">Use Case</h4>
<p>lifetime helps freelancers in keeping track of the work hours, they spend on their projects. The user can define project specific directories and files. These are then tracked if they are worked with. Also a fee can be calculated and used preformatted to be used in billings.</p>
